# Hi, I'm William!

I'm a QA automation engineer with a passion for building things with Python and
C#. I have taken an interest in web apps, which fits well with my testing
experience! Oh, and I also really like cats.

In my spare time, I enjoy drawing and playing chess, so expect a mix of all of
the above when it comes to what I'm posting.
