# Hi, I'm William!

I'm a computer science graduate from Western University. On this blog I will post about a variety of 
things, mostly about my experiences while programming.

In my spare time I enjoy blitz chess, drawing cartoon characters, and bubble tea. 
I also have a really cute cat, so look out for her.
