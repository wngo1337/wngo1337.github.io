# Hi, I'm William!

I'm a recent computer science graduate from Western University with undergraduate coursework focused on application development, software engineering, and databases. I write about software I build and plan on writing more about software testing & engineering! Stay tuned!

In my spare time I enjoy blitz chess, drawing cartoon characters, and bubble tea. 
I also have a really cute cat, so look out for her.
